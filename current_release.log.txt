#08.25.2017 
First release

#09.01.2017
Modified the "run_HiCtrans.pl" script to generate all the chromosome combination translocation result.
Script to generate the genomic feature file is added.

#04.02.2018
Added "noiseReduction.r" script. This script will calculate the extropy of count 
distribution inside the translocation boxes predicted by HiCtrans (*.Translocation.results) 
as compared to random boxes. If there is a true translocation than count distribution 
will be more random and should have high normalized entropy value as compared to similar 
sized random boxes.

#06.19.2018
Added "juiceboxToHiCtrans_MatrixFormat.r" script which converts juiceboxbox output files into
HiCtrans input files (*.bed and *.matrix files)
